# Dbscan_VS_K-means-clustring-algorithms
### Unsupervised Vs supervised Machine learning 
#### UN-Supervised
- No labels are given to the learning algorithm
- goal is to discovering hidden patterns in data 
Ex : Clustering problem

#### Supervised
- The system is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs
- the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
EX : regression problem

### Description of the project
This project include the implementation of K-mean and dbscan from scratch using python and comparison between them by run the both algorithm on same data that may include arbitry shaps to see the behaviour of them with this data

 ##### To know more about the project open the presentation that include explanation and the differences between k-mean and dbscan
